#### Taiwan Housing Price Prediction with Linear Regression
This repository contains an implementation of Linear Regression using Gradient Descent (GD) and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The primary objective is to predict housing prices in Taiwan and fit a regression plane to the dataset.

üè° Problem Statement
The goal is to build a predictive model that accurately estimates housing prices in Taiwan based on available features (e.g., size, location, etc.). This involves:

1.) Training a linear regression model to minimize the prediction error.
2.) Utilizing GD and SGD as optimization methods to determine the best-fit plane.

Visualizations included:

1.) Loss convergence plots for GD and SGD.
2.) 3D scatter plot showing the data points and the regression plane.
