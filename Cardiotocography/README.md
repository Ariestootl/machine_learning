This is a jointwork project where we attempt to develop a new method by increasing the model's ability to effectively predict whether the Fetal Heart Rate is
Normal, Suspect, or Pathological. The following Machine Learning/Deep Learning methods were used:

* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Dimensionality Reduction
* Neural Networks
* LightGBM
