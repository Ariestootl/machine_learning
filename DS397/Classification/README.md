#### Iris Dataset Classification with Neural Networks and SVM
This repository explores classification techniques applied to the Fisher Iris dataset using Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The goal is to classify iris flowers into one of three species based on their sepal and petal measurements.

ðŸŒ¸ Problem Statement
The Iris Dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning. The objective is to develop models that can:

* Accurately classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
* Compare the performance of Neural Networks and SVM in handling this multiclass classification problem.

Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of 150 samples with 4 features:
* Sepal Length
* Sepal Width
* Petal Length
* Petal Width

Classes:
* Iris Setosa
* Iris Versicolor
* Iris Virginica
