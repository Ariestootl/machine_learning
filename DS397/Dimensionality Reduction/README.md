##### Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering on MNIST Dataset

This repository explores dimensionality reduction techniques, including PCA, Kernel PCA (KPCA), and t-SNE, 
applied to the MNIST dataset. After reducing dimensions, DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is used to cluster the data. The goal is to uncover patterns in the high-dimensional dataset 
and evaluate the performance of clustering in the reduced-dimensional space.

🖼️ Problem Statement
The MNIST Dataset is a benchmark dataset containing grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). 
Each image is represented as a 784-dimensional feature vector (28x28 pixels). Due to its high dimensionality, the data is challenging to process efficiently without dimensionality reduction. 
The objectives of this project are:
1.) To reduce the dimensionality of the dataset for visualization and clustering.
2.) To analyze clustering results after applying DBSCAN on reduced features.

🖼️ Dimensionality Reduction Techniques
1.) Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
* Linear technique that projects data onto a lower-dimensional space while retaining maximum variance.
* Visualized the data in 2D and 3D using the top principal components.
2.) Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA)
* Non-linear extension of PCA, using kernel functions to map data into a higher-dimensional space before reducing dimensions.
Explored kernels: Radial Basis Function (RBF)
3.) t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
* Non-linear dimensionality reduction technique that emphasizes preserving local structure.
* Used for 2D and 3D visualizations to identify clusters of digits.
3. Clustering with DBSCAN
* DBSCAN identifies clusters based on the density of points and is robust to noise.
* Applied DBSCAN on features reduced by PCA, KPCA, and t-SNE.
* Key parameters tuned: Epsilon (ε): Maximum distance between two samples to consider them neighbors.
MinPts: Minimum number of points to form a dense region.
